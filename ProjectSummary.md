# Project Summary
# Team 5: E-commerce Customer Service Satisfaction Analysis
The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer service interactions within an e-commerce setting to predict Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Scores. By leveraging data from customer service interactions, including feedback, agent handling times, and product categories, we aim to uncover the key factors driving customer satisfaction. This involves using machine learning to identify patterns and correlations between various features and the CSAT Scores. Our goal is to provide actionable insights that can help improve customer service strategies and overall customer satisfaction on e-commerce platforms.

### Research Questions To Be Addressed
- Can we predict the CSAT Score based on customer service interaction details and order attributes?
- What are the major factors influencing customer satisfaction in e-commerce websites?

## Phase 1: 
 Data Preparation and Analysis
### Tasks:
Data Cleaning: Process the dataset to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Develop new features that could be significant predictors of CSAT Scores, such as the time taken to respond to customer issues and sentiment scores derived from customer remarks.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct an initial analysis to understand the distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data, focusing on how different variables might affect the CSAT Scores.

## Phase 2: Model Development and Evaluation
### Tasks:
Model Selection: Focus on simple yet effective machine learning models that have been covered in class. This includes Linear Regression for a baseline model and Random Forest for capturing more complex relationships.
Training and Validation: Implement cross-validation to assess the models' performance, ensuring they generalize well to unseen data.
Evaluation: Use metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R-squared for regression models to evaluate and compare model performance.

### Class of models to be applied to dataset
Supervised Learning Models:
- Linear Regression: To understand linear relationships between the features and CSAT Scores. (OMITTED)
- Random Forest: To capture non-linear relationships and interactions between variables.
- MLP Classification: To capture non-linear relationships and interactions between variables.

### Algorithms
- Linear Regression: A fundamental approach for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables. (OMITTED)
- Random Forest: An ensemble learning method for classification and regression that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training time and outputting the mean/average prediction of the individual trees.
- MLP: A neural network model used for classification and regression consisting of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, employing nonlinear activation functions, and undergoing iterative weight adjustments for optimization.

### Conclusion
Our team is committed to uncovering the key factors that influence customer satisfaction on e-commerce websites. By applying machine learning algorithms to customer service data, we aim to predict CSAT Scores and provide recommendations to improve customer service quality. This project not only seeks to enhance the customer experience but also offers valuable insights for e-commerce platforms to optimize their customer service strategies.
